# reviews-data-loader
Perform the transform and load portion of the ETL process with given seed data.

I will be loading the seed data into MongoDB as well as PostgresQL

**Note:** The most pertinent code regarding imports reside within _database-loaders_. Everything else was a previous approach which was deemed inefficient and therefore outdated. I will retain them for safekeeping though.
